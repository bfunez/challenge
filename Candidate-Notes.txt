Hi! tried to use Clean Architecture with MVVM, missing interactions and DI to reduce complexity.
because of time there might be some issues with dialogs and location permissions edge cases that I had to leave.
Imported the code for SingleLiveEvent to aid with MutableLiveData firing the same Article multiple times, referenced a page, but I had used this before.
Image resources are from image Asset in Android studio
No Dependency injection for this project :/

Important to run use the latest Android studio or at least Artic Fox 2020.3.1 and Gradle JDK 11.0.10

add your Places key and Maps key on the strings.xml file there is a todo to remind

Thanks for taking a look at this.
